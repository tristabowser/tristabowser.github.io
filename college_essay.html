		Trista Bowser Personal Essay
		</h2>
		<p>
		As a senior in high school, I am starting to look in to different colleges to pursue my interests in the field of Communications and Broadcast Journalism. I think your university would be the perfect fit for me because of the dedicated professors there, the exceptional education offered, the beautiful campus to grow and thrive in.
		</p>
		<p>
		I think that I would make a great addition to your university not only because of my impeccable academic record, but also for my outstanding activity and volunteer achievements. During my four years in high school, I have obtained Honor Roll every semester and Distinguished Honor Roll for one semester. I have been involved in: Class Cabinet, Student Council (President and Treasurer), Interact Club, Photography Club, TV Production Club, Youth Group, Concert/Marching Band, Color Guard, Tennis, Musical Theater, Girl Scouts and so much more! In my free time, I am very active in my youth group and church. I am an altar server. Also, I help with Sunday School as a teacher assistant. Throughout the years, I have worked as a barn hand at a horse farm. Currently, I am a certified lifeguard at our community pool. There, I am responsible for the safety of the patrons, as well as, enforcing the rules. During the summer, I also like to teach swim lessons. A fun job that I recently started is modeling. I signed a contract with a professional talent agency and have participated in a few local and national ad campaigns.

			<p>
		My experiences have taught me a lot about leadership and hard work, as well as, discipline, patience, reliability, trust and respect. I have learned that no matter what I do, even the smallest of things, I can make a positive difference in the world around me!
		</p>
		<p>
        When considering what career path I wanted to take, it was a very difficult decision. However, after much thought and even more research, I found the right fit me - Communications and Broadcast Journalism. I am a very creative thinker. I enjoy public speaking and I excel in planning and organizing. I’m a good writer, I have strong computer and design skills and I am very comfortable in front of a camera. More importantly, I really like people. I enjoy getting to know them, how they think and feel and finding out what I can do to help them. Another reason I chose this major is because my mother studied Communications. She would often share stories with me about how she would host radio shows or do the news for the campus TV station. She said her educational background was broad enough that she could transition swiftly from these roles into more corporate settings, designing brochures and devising marketing strategies. She has reassured me that a degree in Communications can provide me with many various job opportunities in an array of settings from customer service, sales, marketing to event planning, public relations, corporate training, graphic design, publications and broadcast.  I am eager and enthusiastic and know that I am the maker of my own destiny. I’m will to work tirelessly to achieve my goals.

        Your university comes highly recommended and its exemplary reputation speaks for itself.  I am confident that the life lessons and academic support will equip me with everything I need to succeed. I am excited to be a part of the area and all the things there are to explore.
