		Hello and welcome to my site! While you browse through my eportfolio, I encourage you to check out the “About Me” page as to see who I am, what my interests are, and much more information about me! By clicking on the “Portfolio” category, it will take you to a page with recent various types of work that I have accomplished over the years to showcase my best pieces of writing, modeling, speaking/presenting, etc! If you go under the “Resume” category, you will find a list of recent jobs I have obtained and my experience while working. Lastly, if you would like to look at a list of my activities that I am involved in from most recent years to previous and a list of recommendations that I have acquired from various helpful and friendly resources, go to the “References” page. I highly recommend checking it out.  I hope you enjoy your visit and find everything that you need in a fun, easy matter!
