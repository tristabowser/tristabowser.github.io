		NCYC Sponsor Thank You Letter

		Dear Sponsors,
		</ol>
		</ul>
		Thank you so much for the generous donations you have made in order for our Youth Group to go to Indianapolis, Indiana to participate in 2017's National Catholic Youth Conference (NCYC). This year's NCYC was so much different than that of 2015's, however, it was different in a better way. I learned so much more this year than I did in that of previous years. I learned to open up to my faith and trust in God more than ever! During the first day at NCYC, we went to Dave and Buster's, which was pretty awesome! There was so many games and fun activities for both teens and adults to do! When we were done there, we headed to the convention! That was one of my favorite parts! We spent most of our time at NCYC walking around the different booths learning about various organizations, buying Catholic merchandise, playing awesome games, tagging people with Greensburg Diocese stickers, and trading hats. While on the topic of trading hats, I was told by many people in our Youth Group that I was the hat trading master. I started off with the Greensburg Diocese golf hat (with turf on it) and ended up with seven hats! The funniest hat that I acquired was a Japanese Restaurant hat that I collected by trading a lady in the mall food court who was working by passing out free Japanese food a hat that lit up for her work hat, and she agreed! I was so good at trading hats that I got our whole Youth Group the hats they wanted along with some random people I made friends with, and even Father Tyler from Ford City. Father Tyler was thrilled when I got him the hat that he really wanted, which was a Nemo hat. While at the convention, we went to various workshops to learn about our faith in more depth and even in a different perspective. The most memorable experience that I had was when I got the amazing opportunity to introduce Bishop Edward Malesic on the stage of Lucas Oil Stadium in front of 25,000 people! It was so surreal! During our trip, our Youth Group had the chance to have dinner with the Bishop. That was pretty cool. The most astonishing part of the whole trip had to be the Saturday night mass on the very last night at Lucas Oil Stadium. Seeing 25,000 youth who share the same beliefs as you is truly remarkable. The entire mass was so amazing, from watching the 10 minute precession of priests to the silentest moments in the whole stadium.  When it was time for communion, all the priests helped out, they all went to the altar, which was located on the main stage, and they would get the hosts, and walk to their section to give the amazing sacrament of communion to each person. At the end of mass, we headed back to our busses and departed to home. I really miss NCYC. It was such a wonderful and great experience where I made friends and memories that I will cherish and never forget. Thank you once again for your generous donations, it really  means a lot. Without your prayers and support for our Youth Group, we definitely would not have been able to experience this with opened eyes and hearts. Thank YOU!
